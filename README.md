# vike-deku-minimal

Sm√∂l example of Deku + Vike + Vite.

## Install

```bash
pnpm i
```

## Run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The first run will take a while for the purescript files to compile, but it'll be fast after that.

For live reloading, make sure to install the appropriate extension, ie [PureScript IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nwolverson.ide-purescript) for VSCode :+1:.
